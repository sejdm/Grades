#
# This config file named gradingscheme.yml must be placed in the folder for 
# your course grades, i.e. the folder containing the CSV files that you wish to 
# process.
#
# The program takes each input CSV file name as an argument (in case there are 
# many sections), combines the info, performs the calculations, and outputs 
# them in one CSV file named out.csv along with a histogram.png file showing 
# the grade distribution.  Relevant statistics are printed on stdout.
#
# You may use wildcards like this,
#     Grades-exe mat*.csv
# To process the combination of say mat100b1.csv, mat100b2.csv ...


# This section is where you declare the tests/exams and mention how much each 
# is out of, whether and how it is calculated from other tests/exams etc.
exams:
  midterm: 
    # This grade will be referred by "midterm" in this config
     called: Midterm
       # Column name is "Midterm" in the input CSV
     outof: 30
       # midterm is out of 30
     absent: final
       # Use the grade for the final (defined below) if the midterm grade is 
       # marked as absent (any non-numeric value is assumed absent)

  final: 
     called: Final
     outof: 30
     absent: zero 
       # set grade as 0 if absent. Delete/uncomment the above line to mark all 
       # computations that depend on final as absent and the letter grade as I 
       # (incomplete).

  quizzes:
     prefixed: Quiz 
       # This is a collection (not a single grade) of all grades whose column 
       # name begins with "Quiz"; so Quiz 1, Quiz 2, etc. BE CAREFUL that there 
       # are no columns with the same prefix like "Quiz Average" otherwise it 
       # will also be included (perhaps call that "QAvg" instead)!
       
     eachoutof: 5 
       # Each grade (eg. quiz) is out of 5
       # The fact that this yaml field is named "eachoutof" rather than "outof" 
       # is what determines that this is a collection.
     absent: zero 
       # Set each absent grade to be 0. Otherwise, if any quiz is marked 
       # absent, the any averages or other computations based on it will also 
       # have to be marked absent.
  
  quizavg:
     average: quizzes 
       # Take the average of "quizzes"
     drop: 4 
       # Drop the lowest two

  total:
    aggregate: 
     # The weightage of midterm : final : quizavg is 30 : 30 : 40 (the grades 
     # are normalized automatically)
       midterm: 30
       final: 30
       quizavg: 40
     
  letter:
    using: total 
      # Calculate the letter grade based on "total" which is defined above
    scheme: # Cutoffs for each letter grade
      O: 99
      A: 90
      B: 80
      C: 50
      D: 40.1

 
#This is section is where you mention which columns must appear in out.csv
output:
  - called: Id # Name of the column in the output will be Id.
    original: Roll No. 
      # Take the value directly from the column named "Roll No." in the input 
      # csv file. Contrast this with "computed" below.

  - called: Name
    original: Name

  - called: Quiz Avg # The column name in out.csv will be "Quiz Avg"
    computed: quizavg 
      # Take the value from "quizavg" which was defined in the previous section 
      # above.  Since this is not taken directly from the input CSV it is 
      # called "computed" rather than "original".

  - called: Midterm
    computed: midterm

  - called: Final
    computed: final

  - called: Total
    computed: total

  - called: Letter
    computed: letter


statistics: total # Calculate all statistics based on "total" defined above
histogram: 5 # the bin size of the generated histogram is 5
